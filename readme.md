# Introduction to Ruby OOP

## Why OOP?

### Encapsulation

Objects help us build programs that model how we tend to think about the world. Instead of a bunch of variables and functions (procedural style), we can group relevant data and functions into objects, and think about them as individual, self-contained units. This grouping together of properties (data) and methods is called *encapsulation*.

### Managing Complexity

This is especially important as our programs get more and more complex. We can't keep all the code (and what it does) in our head at once. Instead, we often want to think just a portion of the code.

Objects help us organize and think about our programs. If I'm looking at code for a Squad object, and I see it has associated *people*, and those people can dance when the squad dances, I don't need to think about or see all the code related to a person dancing. I can just think at a high level "ok, when a squad dances, all its associated people dance". This is a form of *abstraction*... I don't need to think about the details, just what's happening at a high-level.

### Ensuring Consistency

One side effect of *encapsulation* (grouping data and methods into objects) is that these objects can be in control of their data. This usually means ensuring consistency of their data.

Consider a bank account example... I might define a bank account object such that you can't directly change its balance. Instead, you have to use the `withdraw` and `deposit` methods. Those methods are the *interface* to the account, and they can enforce rules for consistency, such as "balance can't be less than zero".

### Modularity

If our objects are well-designed, then they interact with each other in well-defined ways. This allows us to refactor (rewrite) any object, and it should not cause bugs or require major changes in other areas of our programs.

## The OOP Process

Putting your idea in a nutshell gives you a starting place for what those objects may be:

> "Tic Tac Toe is a game where players try to get three squares in a row."

- Game
- Players
- Squares

> "Amazon is a site where people can order products."

- People
- Orders
- Products


## Instance vs. Class

An object or instance represents an abstract thing, usually with some properties (attributes) and some sort of behavior (methods). A class, in turn, can create many objects with the same set of properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).

### Define and Instantiate a Class

Class definitions require three basic components: the reserved word `class`, a name of the class, and the reserved word `end`. By convention, the class name begins with a capital letter. Everything between the class name and `end` is part of the class definition.

```ruby
class Car
end
```

To create instances of our class, we will create a variable and assign it the return value of the `Car` class's `Car.new` method.

```ruby
# see it in action:
car = Car.new
```

## Adding Properties and Behaviors to Instances

We are able to create instances of a `Car`, but our class is *very* simple and our instances currently don't give us much. We'd like to add properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) for our car instances.

We'll start by looking at **instance methods** for behaviors of individual cars and **instance variables** for properties or attributes of individual cars. 


### Instance Method

An instance method represents a function that is accessible on every instance of a class. To create an instance method, we just create a regular method inside our class definition. Here's the syntax:

```ruby
class Car
  def drive
    puts "You're going places!"
  end
end
```

Now every car we create will have a "drive" behavior.

```ruby
# see it in action:
car.drive
```


### Instance Variable

An instance variable -- which begins with the `@` symbol -- has the capability of storing data for each instance of a class. 
Let's give each instance of `Car` a color using instance variables.

```ruby
class Car
  #instance variable
  @color = "blue"  # we usually won't leave these just floating in class definitions!
  # we can use it elsewhere in the class definition
  p @color
end
```

JavaScript lets us access variables inside objects with syntax like `obj.var` or `obj["var"]`. In Ruby, we won't be able to access instance variables directly - we'll need methods to interact with them.

In order to assign (set) instance variables, we'll need a *setter* method for each variable we want to change from outside the class definition.  In order to access (get) instance variables, we will need a *getter* method for each instance variable that we want to expose outside the class.  

Let's look at an example.

```ruby
class Car
  # setter method: allows you to SET the color
  def color=(color)  
    @color = color
  end

  # getter method: allows you to GET the color
  def color
    @color
  end
end
```

```ruby
# see it in action:
car_one = Car.new
car_one.color = "green" # sets @color using the setter method
car_one.color           # gets @color using the getter method
# => "green"

car_two = Car.new
car_three.color
# => nil
```

Every time an instance of `Car` is assigned a color, it will have its *own* instance variable named `@color`.


Note: since we don't *have* to put parentheses around method parameters when we call them, we can change a car's color with familiar syntax:

```ruby
# see it in action:
bmw.color=("red")
bmw.color="red with FLAME decals"
# both work to change the car's color
```


### method: `initialize`

In Ruby there's a built-in method named `initialize` that is invoked every time a class is instantiated.  We can add custom initialization behavior by creating our own `initialize` method.  Let's prove that this is true by adding a method named `initialize`.

```ruby
class Car
  def initialize   # puts "A brand new carrr" when Car.new is called.
    puts "A brand new car!!!!!!"
  end

  def color=(color)
    @color = color
  end

  def color
    @color
  end
end
```
```ruby
# see it in action:
bmw = Car.new
audi = Car.new
```

If we apply this new knowledge, we can re-write our class definition to give a car a color during instance creation.  

```ruby
class Car
  def initialize(color)
    @color = color
  end

  def color=(color)  
    @color = color
  end

  def color
    @color
  end
end
```

```ruby
# see it in action:
bmw = Car.new "black"
bmw.color
```

Since we don't *have* to put parentheses around method parameters when we call them, we can change a car's color with familiar syntax:

```ruby
# see it in action:
bmw.color=("red")
bmw.color="red with FLAME decals"
# both work to change the car's color
```


### methods: `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`, `attr_accessor`

If we add more methods to our class, we will start to notice a lot of repetition:

```ruby
class Car
  def initialize(color, make)
    @color = color
    @make = make
  end

  def make=(make)
    @make = make
  end

  def make
    @make
  end

  def color=(color)
    @color = color
  end

  def color
    @color
  end
end
```

Every getter has a method with a name (`make` and `color`) that is included in the instance variable (`@make` and `@color`). The same is true for setters.  

Ruby provides a syntax to shorten this common pattern: attributes. Attributes allow for the introduction of a different syntax for creating getters and setters. Let's demonstrate this by using Ruby's attributes to create a getter for `make`.


```ruby
class Car
  attr_reader :make  # getter

  def initialize(color, make)
    @color = color
    @make = make
  end

  def make=(make)
    @make = make
  end

  def color=(color)
    @color = color
  end

  def color
    @color
  end
end
```

```ruby
# see it in action:
bmw = Car.new("red", "bmw")
bmw.make
```

`attr_reader` does the same thing as our former method `make`. We can also use this shorthand syntax to create setters with attributes:

```ruby
class Car
  attr_reader :make  # getter
  attr_writer :make  # setter

  def initialize(color, make)
    @color = color
    @make = make
  end

  def color=(color)
    @color = color
  end

  def color
    @color
  end
end
```

Finally, if we want both a getter (reader) and setter (writer), we can use `attr_accessor`:

```ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :make, :color  # getters and setters!

  def initialize(color, make)
    @color = color
    @make = make
  end
end
```




## Class Methods, Class Variables, and `self`

Now, there may be moments where we want to get or set properties and behaviors that relate to the class itself or to all instances of a class, as a group. In this case, we need to explore class methods and class variables.

Class methods and class variables are used when data pertains to more than just an instance of a class.

### Class Variable 

Let's imagine that we want to keep count of all cars that were instantiated. We use a class variable, indicated by `@@`.


```ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :make, :color
  @@count = 0

  def initialize(color, make)
    @color = color
    @make = make
  end
end

```

### Class Methods with `self`

Adding the class variable was easy enough.  Next, we'll define a getter for it using the keyword `self`.  If you place the word `self` next to a method name, the method is used on the class instead of on any particular instance of the class.

```ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :make, :color
  @@count = 0

  def initialize(color, make)
    @color = color
    @make = make
  end

  def self.count
    @@count
  end
end
```

```ruby
# see it in action:
Car.count
# => 0
```


Our car count isn't actually counting anything yet!  We'll update the count in the `initialize` method so that it increases each time a car is created.

```ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :make, :color
  @@count = 0

  def initialize(color, make)
    @color = color
    @make = make
    @@count = @@count + 1
  end

  def self.count
    @@count
  end
end
```

```ruby
# see it in action:
Car.count
# => 0

bmw = Car.new('red', 'bmw')
Car.count
# => 1

audi = Car.new('silver', 'audi')
Car.count
# => 2
```

## Inheritance

Inheritance lets us reuse code from one class as we create subtypes of that class.


### Base Class

We'll use our `Car` class as a base class and make a new `Pickup` class that inherits from `Car`.  Another way to say this is that `Pickup` will be a *subclass* of `Car`.  You can also think of `Car` as `Pickup`'s parent class and `Pickup` as `Car`'s child class (as in a class inheritance _tree_).

Notice that this `Car` class is spruced up with two new instance variables: `@speed` and `@model`, and an `accelerate` instance method.

```ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :make, :model, :color, :speed
  @@count = 0

  def initialize(color, make, model)
    @speed = 0
    @color = color
    @make = make
    @model = model
    @@count = @@count + 1
  end

  def self.count
    @@count
  end

  def accelerate(change)
    @speed += change
  end
end
```


### Subclass

The syntax for inheritance uses `<` in the class definition.  Our pickup trucks will have another property that cars don't: the capacity of their truck beds (`@bed_capacity`). They'll also have a behavior that allows for riding in the back (`ride_in_back`).

```ruby
class Pickup < Car
  attr_accessor :make, :model, :color, :bed_capacity, :speed

  def initialize(color, make, model, bed_capacity)
    @speed = 0
    @color = color
    @make = make
    @bed_capacity = bed_capacity
    @@count = @@count + 1
  end

  def ride_in_back
    puts "Bumpy but breezy!"
  end
end
```

Even though we didn't define the `accelerate` method again, a pickup truck will inherit the behavior from the `Car` class.

```ruby
# see it in action:
truck_one = Pickup.new("red", "Chevrolet", "Silverado")
truck_one.speed
# => 0
truck_one.accelerate(40)
truck_one.speed
# => 40
```

Inheritance doesn't go the other way, though -- new cars don't know how to use the `ride_in_back` behavior.

```ruby
# see it in action:
cilantro = Car.new("pink", "Kia", "Cilantro")
#=> #<Car:0x007f8c4c1b3520 @speed=0, @color="pink", @make="Kia" @model="Cilantro">
focus.ride_in_back
#=> NoMethodError: undefined method `ride_in_back' for #<Car:0x007f8c4c1b3520 @speed=0, @color="pink", @make="Kia", @model="Cilantro">
```

### Inheritance and Class Variables

Class variables  in Ruby don't interact with inheritance in the way many people would expect.  All subclasses share the same class variable, so **changing a class variable within a subclass changes the class variable for the base class and all other subclasses**.  This can be good when, for instance, we want to update the total `Car` count whenever a new `Pickup` is created. However, `Pickup`'s `@@count` will always be equal to the total `Car` count.  

This connection can cause lots of issues if it's not intended. For example, a `Vehicle` class might have an `@@num_wheels` variable that stores a "default" number of wheels for a vehicle, say 4.  If `Boat` is later created as a subclass of `Vehicle`, and `Boat`'s `@@num_wheels` is set to 0, then all vehicles will now have their number of wheels set to 0, even `Motorcylces`, `Cars`, `EighteenWheelers` and any other instances of `Vehicle` subclasses.

**For this reason, Rubyists try to avoid using class variables whenever possible!**  If you feel you must use a class variable, there's a more complex pattern to help you out: class instance varaibles.

A better pattern that fits this scenario uses "class instance variables". For the "class instance variable pattern", we create an instance variable for the shared data within the parent class itself (outside of a method definition). Then, we create a class getter method within the parent class to access the class instance variable. Finally, we create a new version of the class instance variable for each subclass.  The data is no longer shared among multiple classes when we use this pattern. Let's see an example.

```ruby
class Vehicle
  @num_wheels = 4
  def self.num_wheels
    @num_wheels
  end
end

class Boat < Vehicle
  @num_wheels = 0
end

class EighteenWheeler < Vehicle
  @num_wheels = 18
end
```



## Modules

Ruby "modules" group together related information (attributes and methods).  They're like simplified classes that can't have instances and don't have inheritance. Rubyists often use them for:
  * "namespacing": encapsulation or bundling of related content,
  * "mixins": extra methods that can be added into classes without influencing the inheritance tree


### Namespacing

A commonly used built-in module is `Math`. It encapsulates methods for mathematical concepts like [logarithms](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Math.html#method-c-log) and [square roots](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Math.html#method-c-sqrt) alongside [constants for e and pi](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Math.html#constants-list).  Note how we access the `Math` module's constants with the `::` operator:

```ruby
puts Math::PI
```

The `::` operator has a number of uses related to namespacing. You can think of it as a way to open up a namespace provided by a class or module (like `Math`) and reach inside for a constant (like `PI`).  You'll see this in Rails!

### Mixins

Check out the first example in Ruby's [documentation for `modules`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Module.html) to see how you'd `include` one as a mixin.  You can `include` a module in another module or in a class.  One built-in module that's commonly mixed into classes is [`Comparable`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Comparable.html).

Here's how a simplified `Car` class might look with `Comparable` mixed in to compare cars just based on speed.

```ruby

class Car
  include Comparable
  attr_accessor :speed

  def initialize
    @speed = 0
  end

  def accelerate(change)
    @speed += change
  end

  def <=>(otherCar)
    @speed <=> otherCar.speed
  end
end
```

Note that now two cars can be compared based on speed! For example, two cars with the same speed will now be equal (`==`):

```ruby
# see it in action:
car_a = Car.new
# => #<Car:0x007fea4a871928 @speed=0>
car_b = Car.new
# => #<Car:0x007fea4a869700 @speed=0>
car_a == car_b
# => true
car_a.accelerate(20)
# => 20
car_a > car_b
# => true
```

## Reflection Questions

1. What is the difference between an instance and a class? Can you think of an analogy for this?  
1. In your own words, what are some benefits of object oriented programming?  
1. What are two questions you have about object oriented design or the syntax for object oriented program in Ruby?
